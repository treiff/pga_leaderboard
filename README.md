# PGA Leaderboard
![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/treiff/pga_leaderboard/master/example.png)

Ever wonder how the leaderboard is looking at the current PGA tour event?  Here's your answer.  A simple executable providing a brief overview of the current tournament, leaderboard automatically updates every 3-minutes.

Data is exracted from ESPN&reg; Bottomline as a URI encoded string. Default update from ESPN&reg; is every three minutes.

This was the best data feed I could find (for free) for PGA leaderboard data.  Feel free to mess around with it and make it better,  It does its job for now as long as ESPN&reg; doesn't change their data format. 

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pga_leaderboard

## Usage

Simple, once installed run:

	$ pga leaderboard

To exit ```ctrl^c```
